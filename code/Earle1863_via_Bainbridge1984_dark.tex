``[\dots]inasmuch as insanity is almost uniformly a disorder connected
with bodily disability, a fact apparently never learned until within the
last half-century, it necessarily follows that all customs, habits,
occupations, or other agencies whatsoever which exhaust the power of the
brain and nerves, bringing the body to a weakened condition, may thus
become the origin of mental disorder. Such influences are, indeed the
\emph{ramified root from which insanity springs}.'' (Earle,
1863:56) [emphasis added] \url{https://doi.org/12.2307/3711479}\\
